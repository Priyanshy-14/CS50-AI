# CS50-AI

Welcome to my repository for Harvardâ€™s CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python. This collection features all the projects and problem sets I completed as part of the course. It showcases hands-on implementations of core AI concepts, including search algorithms, knowledge representation, inference, probability, and machine learning. The course explores foundational theories and practical applications of Artificial Intelligence using Python.
